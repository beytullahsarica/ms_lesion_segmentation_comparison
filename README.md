## Abstract

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes lesions in the central nervous system. Accurate segmentation and quantification of these lesions are essential for monitoring disease progression and evaluating treatments. Several architectures are used for such studies, the most popular being the U-Net-based models. Therefore, this study
compares CNN-based and Transformer-based U-Net architectures for MS lesion segmentation. A total of six U-Net architectures based on CNN and transformer, namely, U-Net, R2U-Net, V-Net, Attention U-Net, TransUNet, and SwinUNet, were trained and evaluated on two different publicly available MS datasets ISBI2015 and MSSEG2016. T1-w, T2-w, and FLAIR sequences
were jointly used to obtain more detailed features. A hybrid loss function, the addition of focal Tversky and Dice losses, was used to improve the performance of models. This study was carried out in three steps. First, each model was trained separately and evaluated on each dataset. Second, each model was trained on the ISBI2015 dataset and evaluated on the
MSSEG2016 dataset and vice versa. Finally, these two datasets were combined to increase the training samples and then evaluated on the ISBI2015 dataset. Accordingly, the R2U-Net and the V-Net models (CNN-based) achieved the highest ISBI scores among the other models. The R2U-Net model achieved the highest ISBI scores in the first and last steps with average
scores of 92.82 and 92.91, while the V-Net model achieved the highest ISBI score in the second step with an average score of 91.28. Our results show that CNN-based models surpass the Transformer-based U-Net models in most metrics for MS lesion segmentation.

## Generated NPY files

Generated NPY files from the ISBI2015 and MSSEG2016 training datasets should be placed to the dataset folder as follows:

```
dataset
|───isbi2015
|   | rater_1_train_images.npy
|   | rater_1_train_masks.npy
|   | rater_2_train_images.npy
|   | rater_2_train_masks.npy
|───msseg2016
|   | train_images.npy
|   | train_masks.npy
```

## How to train

To get all options, use -h or --help

```
python train.py -h
```

Here is the training example for the ISBI2015 dataset. Model name can be "unet_2d", "vnet_2d", "r2_unet_2d", "att_unet_2d", "transunet_2d", "swin_unet_2d". Default is "unet_2d"

```
python train.py --dataset_type isbi2015 --model_type unet_2d --validation_split_percentage 0.2 --batch_size 8 --epochs 300
```
